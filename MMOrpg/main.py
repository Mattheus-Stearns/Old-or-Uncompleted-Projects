# Idea for making a role playing game, that would start off playing single-person, as a proof of concept, and if it plays well then turn it into a real game

# Essentially, You have a lot of skills that you can gain after events, and with use of the upgrade tree, you can both unlock new skills and mastery skills
# if other certain skills are both gained and levelled to level 10, and some skills can increase base stats, and there are also seperate upgrade trees for
# each main skill around the game, but each "player" is only entitled to one avatar at a time. This would also allow for combination of the upgrade trees and
# base skills, depending on the player level among other things. This game would allow for passive grinding, but it would also offer mini challenges while
# grinding out skills to both entertain the player and get xp faster, and instead of exponentially increasing xp requirements, once you "farm" an area "dry"
# you don't get that area's xp back anymore, and if they continue to farm there, decrease resource supply, and if they still continue cut off all resources
# and other such things to simulate a destroyed ecosystem, store that data somewhere, and then introduce a quest later to fix that area. Try to make a simple
# yet realistic economy that doesn't allow for exploitation, where once you build rapport with the sellers you get a sale price, and also one that rewards
# exploration.

# Essentially, try to make this a fun game that allows for all kinds of combinations and different playstyles while pushing the players to get better at the
# game themselves, and to do this you need a good and refined combat system, that isnt purely based off of numbers on a screen but also requires skills from
# the player, one that is difficult and increases difficulty intuitively, and have a similar gist for all other systems in play.
